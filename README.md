# Machine learning implementation of basic algorithms in small projects

Algorithms used:

Linear regression 

Logistic regression

SVM (using LIBSVM in MATLAB) and using Sklearn in python

Feedforward neural network (Using MATLAB NN toolbox, using sklearn, also implemented from scratch)

PCA (principal component analysis)

FCA/LDA (fisher linear discriminant analysis)

K-means clustering

linkage clustering

KNN
 
 
 
batch gradient decent

Stocastic gradient decent 

Effect of regularization 



Naive bayes
